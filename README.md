The decision tree (DT) model achieved an accuracy of 0.72 on the test set for the income problem. It showed good precision for classifying the majority class (higher income) with a value of 0.93, but a lower precision of 0.47 for the minority class (lower income). However, the recall was high for the minority class (0.85) compared to the majority class (0.68), indicating that it was better at identifying individuals with lower income. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model performed well with a ROC AUC score of 0.871, indicating a good ability to distinguish between higher and lower income individuals. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.77 on the test set and demonstrated a balanced recall for both income classes at 0.77. The F1-scores were reasonable for both models, with the DT model achieving 0.78 for higher income and 0.60 for lower income, while the logistic regression model achieved 0.83 for higher income and 0.62 for lower income. 
Considering the income problem, the logistic regression model may be the best choice as it achieved a balanced accuracy and recall for both income classes, and its F1-scores were higher compared to the DT model.
